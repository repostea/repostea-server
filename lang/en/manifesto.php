        'intro' => 'Renegados was born as a digital platform with a public service vocation, aimed at facilitating access to diverse information, promoting critical thinking, and fostering constructive debate among people of different ideological sensibilities. In contrast to the noise, polarization, and superficiality of many current spaces, Renegados aims to recover the value of well-constructed arguments, verified information, and mutual respect as pillars of dialogue.',

        'plural_title' => 'A space for plural coexistence',
        'plural' => 'The Renegados community is open to all ideologies and sensibilities, as long as the principles of legality, coexistence, and respect among users are upheld. We want to build a space where dissent is not perceived as a threat, but as an opportunity for mutual learning. Here, difference of opinion will not be penalized, but personal attacks, gratuitous disqualification, or the use of fallacies will be.',

        'content_title' => 'Useful, verified content with added value',
        'content' => 'Content that provides context, sources, verifiable data, and relevant links will be especially encouraged.

We want to recover that spirit in which the best comments were authentic miniature articles that helped to better understand reality.',

        'moderation_title' => 'Fair, consistent, and protective moderation',
        'moderation' => 'The moderation system will avoid both arbitrariness and ideological persecution. Decisions will be well-founded, documented, and open to review.

        'advertising_title' => 'Non-invasive, ideologically aligned, and beneficial advertising',
        'advertising' => 'Renegados will not include advertising from the start. If incorporated in the future, it will be done discreetly, in locations that do not interfere with the user experience and with advertising content aligned with the ethical and cultural principles of the community. Priority will always be given to advertising that can be useful, interesting, or consistent with critical thinking and reader autonomy.',

        'information_title' => 'Information that does not usually appear in mainstream media',
        'information' => 'Renegados will be a forum to share news, experiences, and reports that do not always find an echo in mainstream media. The goal is to give visibility to realities that are silenced or minimized, providing a platform for those who usually don\'t have one.',

        'sustainability_title' => 'Economic sustainability with ethics and limits',
        'sustainability' => 'Although Renegados\'s main objective is not profit, generating income in ways that strictly respect the user experience, editorial independence, and project values is not ruled out. Complementary services, utilities, or tools that add value to users and whose monetization is transparent, ethical, and non-invasive may be developed.',

        'education' => 'One of Renegados\'s pillars will be the promotion of critical thinking. Resources will be made available to users to help them identify misinformation, analyze narratives, verify sources, and build solid arguments. We want Renegados to also be an informal civic school where people can learn to read the world with more tools.',

        'privacy_title' => 'Data protection and enhanced anonymity',
        'privacy' => 'Renegados will only collect data strictly necessary for its operation. The use of anonymization and pseudonymization techniques will be maximized, respecting the right to participate without exposing more personal information than is essential. User data will not be commercialized under any circumstances.',

        'governance_title' => 'Democratic governance and community evolution',
        'governance' => 'As the community grows, Renegados aspires to develop progressive forms of shared governance. Mechanisms for participation in strategic decisions, regulatory reviews, or major functional changes will be implemented. These mechanisms may include public surveys, open debates, or the creation of representative bodies of the community. It\'s about building, together, a space where the community not only interacts but also co-decides.',

We invite anyone interested in a platform based on constructive criticism, responsible freedom, and the will to transform to read it, share it, and, if desired, symbolically sign it. Spaces will also be enabled to comment, propose improvements, or express adherence.',
